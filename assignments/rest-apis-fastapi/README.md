# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Build a functional REST API using the FastAPI framework. You'll learn how to create endpoints, handle HTTP methods, validate request data, and return structured responses to build a modern web service.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a REST API with FastAPI

#### Description
Create a RESTful API that manages a collection of resources (such as books, todos, or users). Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with proper HTTP methods and data validation. Your API should accept JSON input and return JSON responses with appropriate status codes.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a FastAPI application with multiple endpoints
- Implement GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods
- Use request and response models for data validation
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Support filtering or searching through resources
- Include clear error handling and messages

### 🛠️ Test and Document Your API

#### Description
Ensure your API works correctly by testing all endpoints and utilizing FastAPI's automatic documentation features. Test various scenarios including successful requests, invalid inputs, and edge cases.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Test all CRUD operations with sample data
- Verify proper error handling for invalid requests
- Access auto-generated API documentation (Swagger UI or ReDoc)
- Return consistent and meaningful response formats
- Handle edge cases gracefully
